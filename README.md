# Heart Failure Prediction: A mock project for Kaiser Permenente Hospital 

This repository contains a project made for academic progression for the subject Practical Data Science (CS667) at Pace University. 

Guided by: Professor Stephanie Langelend

## Tech Stack 

  Programming language:   Python (3.9)

  Python Libraires used:  Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly (Interactive Viz), Sci-Kit Learn,     


## Executive Summary 

In an effort to enhance patient care and preemptively identify at-risk individuals, the team has developed a sophisticated predictive model for heart failure, tailored specifically for the patient demographics of the Kaiser Permanente hospital chain. Utilizing state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and the rich medical datasets available, our model aims to provide clinicians with a powerful tool to assess heart failure risks, enabling timely interventions and optimizing resource allocation, ultimately driving better patient outcomes and reducing hospital readmissions.
