# Heart Failure Prediction: A mock project for Kaiser Permenente Hospital 

This repository contains a project made for academic progression for the subject Practical Data Science (CS667) at Pace University. 

Guided by: Professor Stephanie Langelend

## Tech Stack 

  Programming language:   Python (3.9)

  Python Libraires used:  Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly (Interactive Viz), Sci-Kit Learn,     


## Project Data Outlook

1. Age : Age of the patient
2. Anaemia : Whether the patient has anaemia (0 for No, 1 for Yes)
3. creatinine_phosphokinase: Level of the enzyme in the blood
4. diabetes: Whether the patient has diabetes (0 for No, 1 for Yes)
5. ejection_fraction: Percentage of blood leaving the heart during each contraction
6. high_blood_pressure: Whether the patient has high blood pressure (0 for No, 1 for Yes)
7. platelets: Quantity of platelets in the blood
8. serum_creatinine: Level of serum creatinine in the blood
9. serum_sodium: Level of serum sodium in the blood
10. sex: Gender of the patient (presumably 0 for Female, 1 for Male)
11. smoking: Whether the patient smokes (0 for No, 1 for Yes)
12. time: Time (not specified if it's in days, weeks, or months)
13. criticality_rank: Ranking of the patient's criticality (higher rank presumably indicates higher risk) **(created for this project)**
14. DEATH_EVENT: Whether the patient had a heart failure event (0 for No, 1 for Yes)

## Executive Summary 

In an effort to enhance patient care and preemptively identify at-risk individuals, the team has developed a sophisticated predictive model for heart failure, tailored specifically for the patient demographics of the Kaiser Permanente hospital chain. Utilizing state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and the rich medical datasets available, our model aims to provide clinicians with a powerful tool to assess heart failure risks, enabling timely interventions and optimizing resource allocation, ultimately driving better patient outcomes and reducing hospital readmissions.
